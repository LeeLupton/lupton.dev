                    <p>My name is Lee Lupton. I'm 25 years old and currently reside in the beautiful coastal town of Morehead City, North Carolina. My academic journey started at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, where I studied for two and a half years. During my time there, I explored various subjects but eventually decided to transfer closer to home. I then spent a year at Carteret Community College, which was a great opportunity to recalibrate and focus on my interests. After that, I took a semester of online courses at Western Carolina University, where I concentrated on finance. This academic experience gave me a strong foundation in financial principles, but I realized I was more captivated by the practical side of things, especially in the stock market.</p>
                    <p>This led me into the world of options trading, where I spent three years trading options contracts. It was an exciting and challenging time—I learned a lot about market dynamics, risk management, and the movement of stock prices. Trading taught me the value of analysis, strategy, and patience. But during this period, something unexpected happened: I discovered a deep interest in programming. While analyzing market data, I started writing small programs to automate tasks, and before I knew it, programming became a new passion of mine.</p>
                    <p>This newfound interest in technology led me to make a significant change. I decided to enroll at North Carolina Central University, where I am now pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I chose this field because I believe cybersecurity is one of the most crucial aspects of our increasingly digital world, and I want to be at the forefront of protecting sensitive information.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I work as the IT Support Specialist at Putnam Real Estate Co in Morehead City, NC. This role has been an excellent way for me to apply my technical skills to real-world problems, helping the office stay secure and efficient in its operations. I enjoy the challenge of solving technical issues and continuously learning more about IT systems and security protocols.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not working or studying, I love to spend my free time outdoors. Golfing is one of my favorite pastimes—I find that it's not just a game but a great way to clear my mind and relax. I also enjoy fishing and spending time on the boat with friends, soaking in the natural beauty of the area. These hobbies help me stay balanced and recharge for the next project or challenge. I was raised in a very supportive family and have a close extended family. We often get together once a month to celebrate holidays and birthdays.</p>
